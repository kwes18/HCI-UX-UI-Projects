This digital prototype is mid-fidelity level version of an application for an interactive map of The University of Winnipeg campus. 
It was created as part of a project for a Human-Computer Interaction course at the university. 
Myself and two others iterated through the steps of the design thinking process. 
First, we analyzed the target audience and stakeholders. Then we did research and to understand the needs and requirements of the potential app users. 
Next, we designed alternatives and created low-fidelity prototypes with paper. All the while considering usability goals and design heuristics. 
After more testing, the users' needs were better understood and steps in the design process were revisited. 
Expert heuristic analysis was applied to the prototype, and the design was improved based on the results. 
Usability testing was conducted with a mid-fidelity digital prototype (linked above). 
As a team, we observed three target users interact with our digital prototype on a computer that was projected onto a large screen.
Data was collected during the usability tests. 
Quantitative data included: the time to complete each task, and the number of errors/incorrect actions that the user took. 
Qualitative data included: having the user utilize think aloud protocol, performing pre and post-testing semi-structured user interviews, and any additional feedback.
