This digital prototype is mid-fidelity level version of an application for an interactive map of The University of Winnipeg campus. 
It was created as part of a project for a Human-Computer Interaction course at the university. 
Myself and two others iterated through the steps of the design thinking process. 
First, we analyzed the target audience and stakeholders. Then we did research and to understand the needs and requirements of the potential app users. 
Next, we designed alternatives and created low-fidelity prototypes with paper. All the while considering usability goals and design heuristics. 
After more testing the users' needs were better understood and steps in the process were repeated. 
Expert heuristic analysis was applied to the prototype, and the design was improved based on the results. 
Usability testing was conducted with the above linked prototype. 
We projected our prototype onto an overhead screen and observed three target users interact with our campus app. 
Quantitative and qualitative data was collected during the usability tests. Including a post interview and timed tasks.
